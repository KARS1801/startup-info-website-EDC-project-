<h2 class="heading"><center><a href="http://www.ampush.com/">1. Ampush</a></center></h2>

<h4>San Francisco, Calif.</h4>
<h4>Founded: 2009</h4>

<h5>What it is:</h5> <p><a href="http://www.ampush.com/">Ampush </a>is a social ad-technology company that works to help brands and direct response advertisers achieve performance at scale with Facebook ads. Clients include MasterCard, Rdio, HotelTonight, Kellogg's, Warrior Dash and Sojo Studios. In 2013 the company got Facebook's seal of approval with it being distinguished as a Strategic Preferred Marketing Developer.</p>

<h5>How it started:</h5> <p>The three co-founders -- Chris Amos, Jesse Pujji and Nick Shahmet -- met at a summer program when they were 17-years-old and ended up rooming together their freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania. After graduating, they went their separate ways, working in consulting and banking. Deciding their career path wasn't for them, the three rejoined and decided to work on Ampush in 2009.</p>

<h5>Why it’s a winner:</h5><p> By being awarded the Strategic Preferred Marketing Developer designation, Ampush is highlighted as one of the companies that continually show commitment to excellence and innovation for Facebook's advertising products. Ampush was one of the first ad-tech companies to partner with Facebook's advertising platform and is constantly focused on advancing their product.</p>

<h2 class="heading"><center><a href="https://www.enplug.com/">2. Enplug</a></center></h2>

<h4>Los Angeles, Calif.</h4>
<h4>Founded: 2012</h4>

<h5>What it is:</h5> <p><a href="https://www.enplug.com/">Enplug </a>is a BtoB startup focused on providing a digital, interactive real-time billboard network. Think restaurant menus or car details splayed on big tablet-like screens.</p>



<h5>How it started:</h5> <p> Talk about a case of serendipity. David Zhu, along with his high school classmate Navdeep Reddy, were working on the development of Enplug. Zhu then took a vacation to Hong Kong and during a chance encounter met Nanxi Lui, who signed up to be the third co-founder. Heading back to the states, Zhu was on an airplane, when a man named Zach Spituslski bumped into him. After apologizing, the two got to talking and Zhu mentioned his venture. The next day Spituslski, along with his roommate Alex Ross became the fourth and fifth co-founders</p>

<h5>Why it’s a winner:</h5><p>  Besides building a startup that takes signage to the next level, the co-founders have quite the extensive background. From Ross building a commodities trading system that is still being used today on Wall Street to Zhu making millions in online poker by the age of 18 to Liu being a youth member of Lady Gaga's Foundation and developing a biotech company named in NASA's Top 10 New Tech Company list, we sure wouldn't bet against this team.</p>

<h2 class="heading"><center><a href="https://www.gsmnation.com/">3. GSM Nation LLC</a></center></h2>

<h4>3. GSM Nation LLC</h4>
<h4>Founded: 2010</h4>

<h5>What it is:</h5> <p>Through its e-commerce platform, GSM Nation offers a wide selection of smart-phones, tablets and other wireless accessories. The company not only sells the physical device but offers a no-contract wireless service plan for consumers who don't want to be locked into long-term agreements. Besides BtoC, GSM Nation offers solutions for organizations ranging from the government agencies to Fortune 500 companies. </p>


<h5>How it started:</h5> <p>  When Ahmed Khattak arrived to the U.S. from Pakistan, the first thought was to call his parents to let them know he was safe. Yet, when he went to buy a phone he was shocked he couldn’t afford to buy one without committing to a two-year contract. Plus, he didn’t he even qualify, because he lacked a Social Security number or credit history.</p>

<h5>Why it’s a winner:</h5><p>  With expectations it will hit $100 million in revenue in 2013 -- only three years after launch -- GSM Nation is a winner in our books. Plus, it is helping consumers save thousands of dollars and offers some individuals, who may not have otherwise qualified for a wireless device, the chance to own one.</p>
